# Effects & Animations Challenge

In this challenge, we'll test your understanding of Animations & Effects in CSS. Modify the template to the right in the following ways:

## Part 1

1. Create a class declaration for .puppy-link and change the color of the text to be green 
2. Add a pseudo-class declaration which will change the .puppy-link text color to pink once it's been visited.
3. Add a pseudo-class declaration which will remove the underline from the link when it's hovered over (you may need to google how to remove underline).

## Part 2

1. Add a pseudo-class declaration for the .puppy-img class which scales it to 1.5x it's width/height.
2. Modify your css so that it takes 2 seconds for the image to scale (transition) once it's hovered over.
3. In addition to scaling, have the image rotate 45 degrees when it's hovered over as well.
4. Google the grayscale() css function, and use it to make the image black & white when it's hovered over.

## Part 3

1. Create a keyframe animation called appear which defines styling at 0%, 50% and 100% of the way through the animation, and attach it to the .puppy-img class (the animation should take 3s).
  1. At 0% of the way through, the width/height of the image should be 100px
  2. At 50% of the way through, the width/height of the image should be 300px
  3. At 100% of the way through, the width/height of the image should be 200px
  4. NOTE: Refresh the web preview to see the animation happen again
2. Play around with additional attributes in the animation, maybe try having the image rotate in different ways using the transform property.
